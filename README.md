# Integration Scripts Profiler
- A simple program that will package MathWorks's HPC cluster integration scripts with goodies to make cluster profile setup in MATLAB easier for the end user and distributor.
- Currently a WIP that does not do much.

To do:
- Settle on some settings
- Assemble the integration scripts with the inputs given
- Allow the user to submit their work to GitHub/GitLab. They must provide the URL to their central repo in their settings
- Give suggestions for cluster names
- Cluster names must be either blank, contain a letter, or number
- Blank cluster names will make the cluster name "HPC"
