# Integration Scripts Profiler
- A simple program that will package MathWorks's HPC cluster integration scripts with goodies to make cluster profile setup in MATLAB easier for the end user and distributor.
- Currently a WIP that... mostly works.

To do:
- Settle on some settings
- Actually test this on Linux and macOS
- Allow the user to submit their work to GitHub too
- Don't attempt to copy things that you don't have if your team isn't parallel
