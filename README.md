# Integration Scripts Profiler
- A simple program that will package MathWorks's HPC cluster integration scripts with goodies to make cluster profile setup in MATLAB easier for the end user and distributor.
- Currently a WIP that... mostly works.
- Taking a break from working on this, since it seems to mostly work, I'd like to focus on other projects, and for my mental health.

To do:
- Settle on some settings
- Allow the user to submit their work to GitHub too
- Figure out why the input field sucks in PowerShell
- Don't attempt to copy things if your team isn't parallel
